            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Pineapple on Pizza Debate refers to the longstanding argument surrounding the merits of Hawaiian pizza, which is a pizza topped with pieces of pineapple. The pizza has long been a subject of internet debate, as vocal critics and supporters have made image macros and various posts taking sides.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Hawaiian Pizza was created in 1962 by Sam Panopoulous at the Satellite Restaurant in Toronto, Canada.[1] While pineapple has been a popular pizza topping since then, it has also long been the target of hatred. The earliest known internet thread about the topic was posted to Neogaf on January 17th, 2009 by TheGrayGhost.</p>

            <h2>Developments</h2>
            <p>The debate has continued online with various degrees of rigor since the early 2010s. On December 19th, 2009, a Facebook page named "Pineapple does NOT belong on PIZZA!" launched and gained over 1,600 likes. The first image macros related to the debate appeared in 2011 in various Advice Animals (shown below).</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Hawaiian Pizza was created in 1962 by Sam Panopoulous at the Satellite Restaurant in Toronto, Canada. While pineapple has been a popular pizza topping since then, it has also long been the target of hatred. The earliest known internet thread about the topic was posted to Neogaf on January 17th, 2009 by TheGrayGhost.</p>

            <h2>Developments</h2>
            <p>The debate has continued online with various degrees of rigor since the early 2010s.
